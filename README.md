# WebcamPiano
 The goal is to replicate the computer vision-based interaction, implementing frame differencing. This assignment is a simplified version of the work done by Memo Akten in his WebCam Piano 2.0. More information on that can be found here (https://www.memo.tv/works/webcam-piano-2/)

Adjusting the slider will affect the sensitivity for the webcam to capture movements via frame differencing.

Slider at 0, meaning it will be the most sensitive to even the slightest of movements:

Slider at 40, meaning it is still reasonably very sensitive to movements:

Slider at 130, meaning it will be less sensitive to movements:

Slider at 255, meaning it will be very insensitive to movements:
